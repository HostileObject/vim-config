# Vim Config
To use this configuration of Vim just copy the .vimrc in your home directory and create a ~/*.vim* directory and create a directory in .vim called *undodir*.  
Then open Vim and let the plugins install.  
Finally, the Last thing needed is to install the YouCompleteMe plugin, by executing:
```
python ~/.vim/plugged/YouCompleteMe/install.py
```
If you want only specific languages (Java, C, TS, etc...) you'll need to use the option: 
```
--<Language>-completer
```
